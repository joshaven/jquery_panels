NOTICE: This project is mostly functional.  Look for complete code soon.

# Web Panels built with jQuery
Web content panels that can be hidden, moved, resized, added to, or removed.  An 
attempt to make dynamic content placement more like playing with Legos.

## License
MIT-License please refer to LICENSE.md

## Getting Started
View the comments in the source code for usage.  I'll move the documentation into 
this file once the API is stable, for now it is easier to document inline.

## Installing
The only file needed for use is "jquery_panel.js".
The pack or min versions of this file (when available) are preferred for production use.  
They exclude excess comments, etc.  

Include one of jquery_panel.js files in your project and include it where desirable.

All other files are supportive in nature: examples, tests, licenses, etc.
